# About WordPress

## General Information

Citing WordPress.org, "WordPress is web software you can use to create a beautiful website or blog."[^1] Simply put, WordPress is a powerful, open-source web publishing software, content management system and a web platform for building rich web applications. People and companies use WordPress for various purposes and reasons, most notably for their blogs, websites, e-commerce solutions and large web portals. At the time of writing, it is estimated that about 24%[^2] of all websites, whose content management system is known, are being run on WordPress. This number is rather astonishing because it means that visiting five random websites, one of them will be a WordPress-powered one.

WordPress, in comparison to other web software and frameworks, is a full-featured, stand-alone web publishing software and content management system. WordPress is written mostly in PHP language, accompanied with JavaScript scripts and CSS stylesheets. At its core, it consists of a request-response routing subsystem, classes for managing database and content, security features and others. Initially, WordPress was started as an open-source hobby project of Matt Mullenweg in 2003[^3]. Since then, web programmers from all around the world have contributed to it, making it robust, secure and fast. However, as there are several bottlenecks in the system, we, web developers, decided to analyze and improve them. Our findings and results are summarized in this thesis.
