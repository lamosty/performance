# Configuring Testing Environment

The benchmarking and WordPress optimizations will be done on a Ubuntu-based VPS server. Ubuntu comes with a prebuilt software packages (through *apt-get* package handling utility), therefore it is quick and relatively easy to install and set up applications we will use.

We are going to use vpsfree.cz[^1] as the server provider. However, content of this work can be reproduced on any kind of modern Ubuntu hosting platforms such as digitalocean.com.[^2]

Specification of the testing server are:

- 3x CPU
- 4GB RAM
- 300Mbps connectivity

We will be using Ubuntu version 14.04.
