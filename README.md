# WordPress Performance Optimizations

In our work, we will be dealing with the performance and speed optimizations of an underlying server and a WordPress-based website running on it. After a thoughtful study of our work, an ordinary web programmer or administrator will be able to install and configure his web server and refactor the source code of his PHP (WordPress) web application, without having to research what to modify or avoid from other sources, thus saving his time and resources. Product of our work will be a highly optimized server with proper caching and a WordPress website developed to be as efficient as possible.
